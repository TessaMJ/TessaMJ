- Defines a class named HelloWorld
- Includes the main method, which serves as the entry point of the program
- Uses System.out.println() to display text in the terminal

## Purpose
This program is commonly used as an introduction to Java programming. It helps in understanding:
- How a Java class is created
- How the main method works
- How to print output to the console

## Output
Hello, World

# Java ArrayList Sorting Program

## Description
This Java program demonstrates how to store numbers in an ArrayList, sort them in ascending order, and display the sorted result. It uses built-in Java utilities to manage and organize data efficiently.

## Program Overview
The program performs the following operations:
- Creates an ArrayList to store integer values
- Adds multiple numbers to the list
- Sorts the list using the Collections.sort() method
- Prints each sorted number to the console using a loop

## Key Concepts Used
- ArrayList from java.util
- Collections class for sorting
- Enhanced for loop for iteration

## Purpose
This program helps in understanding:
- How to use ArrayList in Java
- How to sort data using Collections.sort()
- How to iterate through a collection and print values

## Output
8

# Java LinkedList Program

## Description
This Java program demonstrates the use of a LinkedList to store and manage string elements. It shows how to add elements at specific positions and how to traverse the list using different looping techniques.

## Program Overview
The program performs the following tasks:
- Creates a LinkedList of String values
- Adds elements to the list
- Inserts an element at a specific index
- Displays the list using a for loop
- Displays the list again using an enhanced for-each loop

## Key Concepts Used
- LinkedList from java.util
- Adding elements and inserting at a specific index
- Accessing elements using index-based iteration
- Iterating through a collection using for-each loop

## Purpose
This program helps in understanding:
- How LinkedList works in Java
- Different ways to traverse a LinkedList
- How insertion at a specific position affects the list

## Output
Welcome to Java Programming  
Welcome to Java Programming

# Java Stack Program

## Description
This Java program demonstrates the use of the Stack class to store integer elements and remove them using the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

## Program Overview
The program performs the following operations:
- Creates a Stack of Integer values
- Pushes elements onto the stack
- Checks whether the stack is empty
- Pops elements from the stack until it becomes empty
- Prints each removed element to the console

## Key Concepts Used
- Stack class from java.util
- push() and pop() operations
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior
- while loop for stack traversal

## Purpose
This program helps in understanding:
- How a stack works in Java
- How elements are added and removed from a stack
- How to use isEmpty() to safely pop elements

## Output

# Java Queue Program

## Description
This Java program demonstrates how a Queue stores and manages string elements. The elements are automatically arranged based on their natural alphabetical order.

## Program Overview
The program performs the following actions:
- Creates a Queue of String values
- Inserts elements into the queue
- Displays the contents of the queue

## Key Concepts Used
- Queue class from java.util
- Queue interface
- add() method for inserting elements
- Natural ordering of String elements
- Automatic sorting mechanism

## Purpose
This program helps in understanding:
- How Queue works internally
- How elements are ordered in a queue
- Basic operations performed on a queue 

## Output
[Java, Programming]
